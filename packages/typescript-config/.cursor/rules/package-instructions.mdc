# TypeScript Config Package Guidelines

- Follow project-wide standards in `.cursor/rules/project-guidelines.mdc`.
- Shared TypeScript config presets for all apps and packages.
- Presets:
  - `base.json`: Basic TS config
  - `nextjs.json`: For Next.js apps
  - `react-library.json`: For React packages
- To use, add as a devDependency and extend the relevant config in your `tsconfig.json`.
- Ensure compatibility with all apps and packages in the monorepo.
- For more info, see [Using shared TypeScript configs in Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/docs/guides/tools/typescript).
- For build and deploy, see Turborepo docs: https://turbo.build/repo/docs
