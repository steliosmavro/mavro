## Proposed Structure

### 1. Enhanced Type Definitions

```typescript
interface Highlight {
    text: string;
    priority: 'primary' | 'secondary';
    category?: 'impact' | 'technical' | 'leadership' | 'architecture';
    metrics?: string; // "1.2K+ users", "10x improvement", etc.
}

interface ProjectHighlights {
    summary: string; // One-line impact statement
    primary: string[]; // 2-3 core achievements with metrics
    secondary: string[]; // Technical details, implementation specifics
    metrics?: {
        users?: string;
        performance?: string;
        revenue?: string;
        scale?: string;
    };
}

interface ExperienceHighlights {
    roleImpact: string; // One-line role summary
    primary: string[]; // 2-3 major contributions
    secondary: string[]; // Additional technical achievements
    leadership?: string[]; // Leadership/mentorship highlights
}

interface SkillCategory {
    name: string;
    primary: string[]; // Core, production-ready skills
    secondary: string[]; // Familiar, learning, or supplementary
}
```

### 2. Content Priority System

**Primary Highlights** (Always included):

- Quantified impact (users, revenue, performance)
- Major feature launches
- Leadership and strategic contributions
- Open source contributions with metrics
- Acquisition/exit details

**Secondary Highlights** (Included in full version):

- Technical implementation details
- Specific technologies used
- Architecture decisions
- Process improvements
- Tool configurations

### 3. Resume Generation Modes

**Concise Mode** (1 page):

- Summary + role impact statements
- Primary highlights only
- Core skills
- Key metrics
- 3-4 featured projects

**Standard Mode** (1.5-2 pages):

- Expanded summary
- Primary + select secondary highlights
- All featured projects
- Primary and some secondary skills

**Comprehensive Mode** (2+ pages):

- Full technical details
- All highlights
- All projects with descriptions
- Complete skill inventory
- Additional sections (testimonials, etc.)

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Update Types**: Add highlight priorities to existing interfaces
2. **Migrate Data**: Convert existing arrays to primary/secondary structure
3. **PDF Generator**: Add mode parameter to control output
4. **Smart Selection**: Algorithm to pick best highlights based on:
    - Available space
    - Role relevance
    - Recency
    - Impact metrics

## Example Migration

```typescript
// Before
highlights: [
  'Built open-source AI chat platform',
  'Implemented real-time streaming',
  'Added rate limiting'
]

// After
highlights: {
  summary: 'Built open-source AI chat platform serving developers with sub-50ms latency',
  primary: [
    'Built open-source AI chat platform optimized for developer workflows',
    'Achieved sub-50ms response latency with 99.9% uptime',
    'Grew to 500+ daily active developers within 2 months'
  ],
  secondary: [
    'Implemented Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming',
    'Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o/3.5 and Claude 3.5 models',
    'Built extensible tool system with Zod schemas',
    'Added Upstash Redis rate limiting at edge'
  ],
  metrics: {
    performance: 'Sub-50ms latency',
    users: '500+ daily active',
    reliability: '99.9% uptime'
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Update TypeScript interfaces
2. Create migration utilities
3. Update all data files with new structure
4. Modify PDF generator to use new system
5. Add resume mode selection
