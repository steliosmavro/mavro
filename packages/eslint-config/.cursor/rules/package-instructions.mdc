# ESLint Config Package Guidelines

- Follow project-wide standards in `.cursor/rules/project-guidelines.mdc`.
- Shared ESLint configuration for all apps and packages.
- Configs:
  - `base.js`: Base config
  - `next.js`: Next.js apps
  - `react-internal.js`: React packages
- To use, add as a devDependency and import the relevant config in your app/package.
- Ensure compatibility with all apps and packages in the monorepo.
- For more info, see [Using shared ESLint configs in Turborepo](mdc:https:/turborepo.com/docs/guides/tools/eslint).
- For build and deploy, see Turborepo docs: https://turbo.build/repo/docs
