# Next.js & React Guidelines

## Component Patterns
- Organize code by feature/domain within `src/` (e.g., `components/`, `lib/`, `context/`, `content/`).
- **Pages (smart components):** Orchestrate state, interact with services, allocate tasks, and compose UI components.
- **UI (dumb/pure components):** Stateless, expect data only as props, have no side effects, and always return the same output for the same input.

## Linting & Formatting
- Use the shared ESLint config (`@repo/eslint-config`) and Prettier for formatting.
- No relative package imports (`import/no-relative-packages`).
- Enforced rules for React/Next.js best practices and hooks.
- All code is type-checked (`tsc --noEmit`).

## References
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for workflows and advanced usage.
