I love AI coding assistants, but I noticed something: they're becoming increasingly expensive and complex. Tools like Cursor and Copilot are powerful, but they process entire codebases, require subscriptions, and can be overkill for many tasks.

So I built [MavroChat](https://github.com/steliosmavro/mavro) - exploring what happens when you take a different approach: lightweight, focused, and accessible.

## The Inspiration: Focused Development

While building various projects, I kept finding myself in situations where I needed quick AI assistance for specific code snippets. I didn't need my entire codebase analyzed - just a function explained, an error debugged, or a pattern suggested.

This "zen mode" approach became the core philosophy of MavroChat:

- **Paste only what matters** - No codebase indexing needed
- **Get instant answers** - Optimized for speed over comprehensive analysis
- **Stay in control** - You decide exactly what code to share
- **Keep it accessible** - Free tier for everyone, premium features for power users

## What I Built

MavroChat is an open source AI chat interface specifically designed for developers. As a developer tool, it focuses on what matters most:

- **Beautiful code formatting** - Syntax highlighting with Shiki
- **Real-time streaming** - Responses appear as they're generated
- **Developer tool integration** - Extensible tool system for custom functions
- **Multiple AI provider support** - Use OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5) or Claude (3.5 Sonnet, 3.5 Haiku) models
- **Bring Your Own API Key (BYOK)** - Use your own API keys for unlimited usage
- **Open source first** - Fork, customize, and self-host with complete control

## When MavroChat Shines

### Perfect for Focused Development

MavroChat excels when you need:

- **Quick code reviews** - Paste a function, get instant feedback
- **Error debugging** - Share just the stack trace and relevant code
- **API exploration** - Ask about specific endpoints without sharing your entire app
- **Learning new concepts** - Get explanations without subscription pressure
- **Code generation** - Generate boilerplate without token limits

### Real Developer Workflows

Here's how I use MavroChat daily:

```typescript
// Instead of sharing my entire app, I paste just what matters:
function processPayment(amount: number) {
    // ... 20 lines of code ...
}
// "How can I add retry logic to this function?"
```

This focused approach means faster responses, lower costs, and better privacy.

## Technical Architecture: Built for Simplicity

### Making It Sustainable

One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to keep it accessible while sustainable. The solution:

- **Rate limiting** - Fair usage limits (10 messages/day) prevent abuse while keeping it free
- **Bring Your Own API Key** - Use your own OpenAI or Anthropic keys for unlimited usage
- **Self-hosting** - Deploy your own instance with complete control
- **No lock-in** - Your keys are stored locally in your browser, never on our servers

The lightweight architecture means running costs stay minimal, allowing for generous free tiers that actually work for daily development.

### Core Developer Features

- **Model flexibility** - Unlike ChatGPT or Claude that lock you into their models, choose from multiple AI providers
- **API key management** - Clean, minimal UI for managing your own API keys securely
- **Tool integration** - Built on Vercel AI SDK's tool system, easily extend with custom developer tools
- **Open source foundation** - Full transparency and customization, a true developer tool
- **Instant streaming** - Sub-50ms response times using Server-Sent Events
- **Beautiful code handling** - Syntax highlighting, one-click copy, proper formatting

## Built with Modern Stack

The tech choices prioritize performance and developer experience:

- **Next.js 15** - For blazing-fast performance and edge functions
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Seamless streaming and tool integration
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development
- **Turborepo** - Monorepo structure for future growth

## Why Open Source Matters

MavroChat is completely open source because I believe developer tools should be:

- **Transparent** - See exactly how it works
- **Extensible** - Add your own features
- **Self-hostable** - Your data, your servers
- **Community-driven** - Built by developers, for developers

### The GitHub Advantage

The entire codebase is on [GitHub](https://github.com/steliosmavro/mavro), which means:

- Fork it and customize for your team
- Contribute features you need
- Learn from the implementation
- Use it as a starter for your own AI projects

## Getting Started is Simple

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/steliosmavro/mavro
cd mavrochat

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add your API keys (OpenAI and/or Claude)
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start developing
npm run dev
```

Or try the [live demo](https://mavro.chat/landing) - no signup required!

**Pro tip**: You don't need to set up API keys in `.env` if you bring your own keys through the UI. Just click the API key button on the right side of the chat interface and enter your keys there for unlimited usage.

## Technical Challenges I Overcame

### 1. Building an Extensible Tool System

One of the most interesting challenges was creating a developer-friendly tool system. Using Vercel AI SDK's tool framework, I built a foundation where developers can easily add custom functions:

- Type-safe tool definitions with Zod schemas
- Seamless integration with the chat flow
- Easy to extend with your own developer tools

### 2. Rate Limiting at the Edge

Implementing fair rate limiting without a traditional backend taught me about:

- Edge function capabilities
- IP-based identification challenges
- Balancing user experience with sustainability

### 3. Making It Truly Open Source

There's a difference between "source available" and genuinely open source:

- Clear documentation for contributors
- Easy local development setup
- Flexible deployment options

## Who Benefits Most

MavroChat is perfect for:

- **Students** learning to code without monthly subscriptions
- **Indie developers** watching their budget
- **Open source contributors** who prefer free tools
- **Privacy-conscious developers** who want control
- **Anyone** who prefers focused, zen-mode coding

## What I Learned

Building MavroChat as an open source developer tool taught me valuable lessons:

1. **Open Source Developer Tools** - The unique challenges of building tools for developers who will read your code
2. **AI Integration** - Deep understanding of streaming, tool calling, and model management
3. **Sustainable Open Source** - How to balance free access with operational costs
4. **Developer Experience** - Why focused, lightweight tools still have their place alongside AI agents

## The Philosophy

I believe AI assistance should be accessible to every developer. Not everyone needs or can afford $20-40/month subscriptions. By keeping MavroChat lightweight and focused, it can offer:

- A free tier for everyday use (10 messages/day)
- Bring Your Own Key option for unlimited usage
- Complete transparency through open source
- Self-hosting for ultimate control
- Local key storage for privacy and security

## Try It Out

If you're curious about the project:

- Check out the [live demo](https://mavro.chat/landing) - no signup required
- Explore the [source code](https://github.com/steliosmavro/mavro)
- Self-host with your own API keys
- Contribute features or improvements

MavroChat might not replace your AI coding agent, but for quick questions, code reviews, and focused development sessions, it offers a refreshing alternative.

Because sometimes, you just need a simple chat that understands code.
