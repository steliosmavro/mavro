Building a trading bot was never the plan. It started as a tool for myself, evolved into a product, and ended with an acquisition. Here's the technical story behind EzPump.

## The Genesis

In late 2024, Solana meme coins were exploding. The opportunity was clear, but the tools were lacking:

- Existing bots had terrible UX
- Most required complex wallet setups
- None offered the features power traders needed

I built EzPump to solve my own trading needs. Within weeks, traders in my network wanted access.

## Technical Architecture

### Why Telegram?

- **Built-in Authentication**: Telegram handles user identity - no signup/login needed
- **User Trust**: Crypto traders already live in Telegram
- **Real-time Updates**: Native support for instant notifications

### The Stack

```typescript
// Core Technologies
- TypeScript with Node.js for type safety
- Telegraf framework for bot integration
- @solana/web3.js for blockchain interaction
- MongoDB with Mongoose for user data
- NestJS for API endpoints
- Jito for fast, low-cost MEV-protected transactions
```

### From MVP to Production Architecture

The first month, I built everything with pure TypeScript and Node.js Telegram Bot API — no fancy architecture, just fast implementation to solve the problem and get users on board. It worked, but as features grew, the codebase became unwieldy.

Month two was a complete refactor:
- **Migrated to NestJS** for dependency injection and scalable architecture
- **Adopted Telegraf** - the best Telegram framework with session handling, middleware support
- **Database schema redesign** - Completely migrated to a new MongoDB schema optimized for scale
- **Modular design** - each feature (volume bot, bundler, comment bot) became a separate module
- **Clean separation** - business logic, API routes, and bot handlers properly organized

This refactor paid dividends - new features that would've taken days now took hours, and the new schema handled growth effortlessly.

## Key Features That Drove Growth

### 1. Volume Generation Bot

Traders needed to boost their tokens' visibility on pump.fun. I engineered a clever system that:

- Created dedicated wallets for each user automatically
- Automatically created and branded pump.fun accounts with EzPump logo, description, and name
- Applied strategic "bumps" - executing buy and sell orders in the same transaction block
- Generated real volume without users losing money (net zero trades)
- Exploited pump.fun's algorithm that promoted high-volume tokens to homepage visibility

```typescript
// Volume generation through atomic bumps
const generateVolumeBump = async (config: BumpConfig) => {
    const userWallet = await createOrGetUserWallet(config.userId);
    
    // Update pump.fun profile with EzPump branding
    await updateProfile(userWallet, {
        name: config.customName || 'EzPump Trader',
        image: EZPUMP_LOGO,
        bio: 'Powered by @EzPumpFun'
    });

    // Execute buy and sell in same block
    const tx = new Transaction();
    tx.add(buyInstruction(config.token, config.amount));
    tx.add(sellInstruction(config.token, config.amount));
    
    // Net zero for user, maximum impact for algorithm
    await sendAndConfirmTransaction(tx);
};
```

### 2. Token Bundler

The killer feature - create and buy tokens in the same transaction:

```typescript
async function bundleTokenLaunch(params: BundleParams) {
    const tx = new Transaction();

    // Create token on Pump.fun
    tx.add(createTokenInstruction(params));

    // Create new wallets
    const buyers = await generateBuyerWallets(params.buyerCount);

    // Add buy instructions for each wallet
    for (const buyer of buyers) {
        tx.add(createBuyInstruction(buyer, params.amount));
    }

    // Execute atomically
    return await sendAndConfirmTransaction(tx);
}
```

## Scaling Challenges

### 1. RPC Strategy for Scale

At 1K+ users, RPC performance was critical. My solution:

- **Jito for all transactions** - Extremely fast execution with lower fees than standard Solana
- **Mainnet RPC for queries** - Account lookups, balances, hashblock verification
- **Premium Helius subscription** - Ensured users always had quick transaction confirmations
- **Smart routing** - Transactions via Jito, reads via mainnet, premium fallback via Helius

### 2. Smart Wallet & Fee Management

Built a sophisticated wallet system with secure key storage and intelligent fee calculation. Generated wallets for each user with private keys hashed and secured in the database:

```typescript
// Smart fee estimation before bumping
const calculateTotalFees = async (bumpConfig: BumpConfig) => {
    const fees = {
        pumpFun: PUMP_FUN_FEE,
        solanaBase: BASE_TX_FEE,
        jitoTip: bumpConfig.jitoTip || DEFAULT_JITO_TIP,
        slippage: calculateSlippage(bumpConfig.amount, bumpConfig.slippageBps),
        rent: await calculateRentForNewAccounts(),
        botFee: calculateBotFee(user.subscription, bumpConfig.amount)
    };
    
    return {
        total: Object.values(fees).reduce((a, b) => a + b),
        breakdown: fees,
        possibleBumps: Math.floor(balance / fees.total),
        estimatedTime: calculateBumpTime(bumpConfig.frequency)
    };
};
```

### 3. Advanced Features That Set Us Apart

**Customizable Trading Parameters:**
Users had full control through settings:
- **SOL Amount**: How much to use per bump
- **Bump Frequency**: Time interval between bumps
- **Max Bump Limit**: Stop after X bumps to control spending
- **Priority Fee**: Higher fees = faster transactions (with speed impact warnings)
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Maximum acceptable price movement

**Flexible Business Models:**
- **Token Passes**: One-time purchase for unlimited bumps on specific tokens
- **Pay-Per-Bump**: Traditional fee on every transaction
- **Service Pass**: Lifetime access with zero bot fees
- **Referral System**: 50% commission on fees from invited users

**Comment Bot with Anti-Detection:**
```typescript
// Reverse-engineered browser comment submission
const postComment = async (message: string) => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
        args: ['--proxy-server=' + getRotatingProxy()]
    });
    
    // Submit comments through browser automation
    await navigateToPumpFun(page);
    await page.type('#comment-box', message);
    await page.click('#submit-button');
    
    // Rotate proxy for next request
    await browser.close();
};
```

### 4. Smart Notification System & User Retention

Built a comprehensive notification system to keep users engaged:

**Real-time Alerts:**
- Trade confirmations with transaction details
- Balance updates after deposits/withdrawals  
- Error alerts with actionable solutions
- Bump completion summaries

**Newsletter Strategy:**
- Regular updates to keep the bot top-of-mind
- New feature announcements
- Trading tips and successful user stories
- Market insights to drive engagement

This notification system was crucial for retention - users who received regular updates were 3x more likely to remain active.

## The Growth Journey: 0 to 1.2K Users

### Strategic Growth & User Acquisition

**Smart Onboarding with Free Trials:**
```typescript
// Automated onboarding that converted
const onboardNewUser = async (userId: string) => {
    // Create wallet immediately
    const wallet = await createUserWallet(userId);
    
    // Don't make user wait for pump.fun setup (can take seconds)
    setupPumpFunProfile(wallet).catch(handleProfileError);
    
    // Hook them with value immediately
    await sendWelcomeMessage(userId, quickStartGuide);
    await grantFreeTokenPass(userId); // Free trial to build familiarity
    
    // Track everything
    await trackEvent('user_onboarded', { userId, freePassGranted: true });
};
```

**Multi-Channel Growth Strategy:**

1. **Organic Network Effect** - Started with my network, EzPump branding on pump.fun profiles spread awareness
2. **Telegram Groups** - Direct promotion in crypto trading communities
3. **Professional Presence** - Built website, created branded email, established Twitter presence
4. **Paid Twitter Growth** - Premium account + promoted posts drove significant traffic
5. **Open-Source Credibility** - After launching v2, made the codebase open-source for developers to learn from
6. **24/7 Comment Bot Marketing**:
```typescript
// Real-time token monitoring via WebSocket
const marketingBot = () => {
    pumpFunWebSocket.on('newTokenCreated', async (mint: string) => {
        try {
            await postMarketingComment({
                tokenMint: mint,
                message: getRandomMarketingMessage(),
                // Race to be first = lifetime visibility
            });
        } catch (err) {
            // Handle rate limits, retry logic
        }
    });
};
```

**Data-Driven Optimization:**
- Tracked offer views vs. purchases
- Analyzed bump frequency by pricing plan
- Monitored user activity patterns
- Identified drop-off points for improvement

### Community Marketing Engine

- Built active Twitter/X presence [@EzPumpFun](https://x.com/EzPumpFun) for updates and community engagement
- Automated success story sharing across social channels
- Referral program with instant rewards
- Community competitions with leaderboards
- Strategic partnerships with alpha groups

## The Acquisition

After 8 months of growth from November 2024 to June 2025, we hit 1.2K active users. MicroPump — the pioneer and first bot on pump.fun — approached with an offer I couldn't refuse. They were building a comprehensive trading ecosystem and wanted:

### What They Valued

1. **The User Base**: 1.2K+ active, paying users
2. **Robust Architecture**: EzPump's maintainable codebase designed for easy feature additions
3. **The Bundler Technology**: Our unique approach to token creation
4. **Anti-Detection Systems**: Sophisticated proxy rotation and behavioral patterns
5. **The Brand**: EzPump had become synonymous with reliable Solana trading bots

### The Transition Process

The handover took 4 weeks of intensive technical work:

**Technical Migration Challenges:**

```typescript
// Complex database migration between different schemas
const migrationScript = async () => {
    // EzPump's NestJS schemas → MicroPump's Node.js structure
    const users = await ezpumpDB.getUsers();
    
    for (const user of users) {
        const transformedUser = {
            // Map EzPump fields to MicroPump schema
            micropump_id: generateNewId(),
            telegram_id: user.telegramId,
            wallets: transformSchema(user.wallets),
            subscription: mapSubscriptionModel(user.plan),
            // Preserve all historical data
            legacy_data: user
        };
        
        await micropumpDB.insertUser(transformedUser);
    }
};
```

**Key Challenges Solved:**

1. **Schema Migration**: Developed and tested migration scripts in dev before flawless production execution
2. **Framework Translation**: Ported EzPump's NestJS features to MicroPump's Node.js architecture
3. **Zero Downtime**: Users experienced seamless transition with no service interruption
4. **Data Integrity**: All user wallets, balances, and subscription data preserved perfectly

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with Your Own Needs

The best features came from my own trading frustrations. Dog-fooding led to genuine innovation.

### 2. Speed is Everything

In crypto, being first matters more than being perfect. Ship fast, iterate faster.

### 3. Community is Your Moat

Technical features get copied. Your community doesn't. I invested heavily in user support and feedback loops.

### 4. Prepare for Success

I didn't expect 1K+ users. When growth hit, architecture decisions made early saved us:

- Stateless bot design
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Proper abstraction layers

### 5. Security First

One hack could've ended everything. Security measures included:

- Encrypted wallet storage
- Rate limiting everything
- Audit logging
- Regular security reviews

## Technical Takeaways

Building EzPump taught me:

- **Blockchain development** requires different thinking
- **Real-time systems** need careful architecture
- **User trust** in crypto is everything
- **Performance** directly impacts revenue

## Impact Beyond the Acquisition

Open-sourcing EzPump after the v2 refactor had unexpected benefits:
- Developers learned from the architecture patterns
- Some forked and built their own variations
- Established credibility in the developer community
- Proved that execution matters more than code secrecy

## What's Next?

The acquisition was a win, but the journey continues. I'm applying these lessons to new projects, focusing on the intersection of AI and blockchain.

Building in crypto is wild - the pace, the users, the opportunity. If you're considering it, my advice: start building. The ecosystem needs more builders who care about user experience.
