Building a trading bot was never the plan. It started as a tool for myself, evolved into a product, and ended with an acquisition. Here's the technical story behind EzPump.

## The Genesis

In early 2024, Solana meme coins were exploding. The opportunity was clear, but the tools were lacking:
- Existing bots had terrible UX
- Most required complex wallet setups
- None offered the features power traders needed

I built EzPump to solve my own trading needs. Within weeks, traders in my network wanted access.

## Technical Architecture

### Why Telegram?
- **Instant Distribution**: No app store approval
- **Built-in Payments**: Telegram Stars for subscriptions
- **User Trust**: Crypto traders already live in Telegram
- **Real-time Updates**: Native support for instant notifications

### The Stack
```typescript
// Core Technologies
- Node.js with TypeScript for type safety
- Telegraf.js for Telegram integration
- @solana/web3.js for blockchain interaction
- PostgreSQL for user data
- Redis for rate limiting and caching
- Bull for job queues
```

## Key Features That Drove Growth

### 1. Volume Generation Bot
Traders needed to create organic-looking volume. I built a system that:
- Distributed trades across time
- Varied transaction amounts
- Used multiple wallets
- Mimicked human patterns

### 2. Token Bundler
The killer feature - create and buy tokens in the same transaction:
```typescript
async function bundleTokenLaunch(params: BundleParams) {
  const tx = new Transaction();
  
  // Create token on Pump.fun
  tx.add(createTokenInstruction(params));
  
  // Create new wallets
  const buyers = await generateBuyerWallets(params.buyerCount);
  
  // Add buy instructions for each wallet
  for (const buyer of buyers) {
    tx.add(createBuyInstruction(buyer, params.amount));
  }
  
  // Execute atomically
  return await sendAndConfirmTransaction(tx);
}
```

### 3. Instant Buy/Sell
Speed matters in meme coins. I optimized for sub-second execution:
- Pre-signed transactions
- Parallel RPC calls
- Optimistic UI updates
- Fallback nodes for reliability

## Scaling Challenges

### 1. RPC Limits
At 1K+ users, we hit Solana RPC limits constantly. Solution:
- Implemented RPC pooling
- Added intelligent request routing
- Built fallback mechanisms
- Created caching layer for read operations

### 2. Wallet Management
Managing thousands of wallets securely was complex:
```typescript
// Hierarchical Deterministic wallet generation
function deriveWallet(userId: string, index: number) {
  const seed = hmac(MASTER_SEED, `${userId}:${index}`);
  return Keypair.fromSeed(seed);
}
```

### 3. Telegram Rate Limits
Telegram limits bot messages. I built a priority queue:
- Critical alerts (trades) sent immediately
- Status updates batched
- Marketing messages throttled
- User-specific rate limiting

## The Acquisition

After 6 months and 1.2K active users, MicroPump approached. They were building a trading ecosystem and wanted EzPump's:
- User base
- Technical infrastructure
- Bundler technology

### Technical Due Diligence
They scrutinized everything:
- Code quality and architecture
- Security measures
- Scalability potential
- Technical debt

Having clean, well-documented code paid off.

### The Handover
I spent a month on:
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- Documentation updates
- Integration planning
- Team training

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with Your Own Needs
The best features came from my own trading frustrations. Dog-fooding led to genuine innovation.

### 2. Speed is Everything
In crypto, being first matters more than being perfect. Ship fast, iterate faster.

### 3. Community is Your Moat
Technical features get copied. Your community doesn't. I invested heavily in user support and feedback loops.

### 4. Prepare for Success
I didn't expect 1K+ users. When growth hit, architecture decisions made early saved us:
- Stateless bot design
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Proper abstraction layers

### 5. Security First
One hack could've ended everything. Security measures included:
- Encrypted wallet storage
- Rate limiting everything
- Audit logging
- Regular security reviews

## Technical Takeaways

Building EzPump taught me:
- **Blockchain development** requires different thinking
- **Real-time systems** need careful architecture
- **User trust** in crypto is everything
- **Performance** directly impacts revenue

## What's Next?

The acquisition was a win, but the journey continues. I'm applying these lessons to new projects, focusing on the intersection of AI and blockchain.

Building in crypto is wild - the pace, the users, the opportunity. If you're considering it, my advice: start building. The ecosystem needs more builders who care about user experience.
