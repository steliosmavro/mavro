When I set out to build MavroChat, I had a clear vision: create an AI chat interface that developers would actually enjoy using. Not another generic chatbot, but a tool that understands code, supports proper syntax highlighting, and integrates seamlessly into a developer's workflow.

## The Problem with Existing Solutions

Most AI chat interfaces treat code as an afterthought. They either:
- Display code in plain text without syntax highlighting
- Break formatting when copying and pasting
- Don't support streaming responses for long code outputs
- Lack developer-specific features like model selection

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Streaming Markdown Support

One of the first challenges was implementing proper streaming support for Markdown content. When an AI is generating a long code explanation, users shouldn't have to wait for the entire response before seeing anything.

```typescript
const streamResponse = async (response: ReadableStream) => {
  const reader = response.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    
    const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
    // Parse and render markdown incrementally
    updateMarkdown(chunk);
  }
};
```

### 2. Model Selection and Context

Different tasks require different models. Sometimes you need GPT-4 for complex reasoning, other times Claude for better code understanding. MavroChat lets developers switch models on the fly while maintaining conversation context.

### 3. Developer-First Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Automatic language detection and highlighting
- **Copy Code Buttons**: One-click copying with proper formatting
- **File Tree Navigation**: Browse and reference project files
- **Tool Invocation**: Direct integration with development tools

## Technical Architecture

The architecture follows a modular approach:

```
├── Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
│   ├── Streaming UI Components
│   ├── Markdown Renderer
│   └── Model Selector
├── API Layer
│   ├── LLM Provider Abstraction
│   ├── Stream Processing
│   └── Tool Integration
└── Infrastructure
    ├── Vercel Deployment
    └── Edge Functions
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the Developer Experience**: Every feature should make developers more productive
2. **Streaming is Non-Negotiable**: Users expect real-time responses
3. **Flexibility Matters**: Support multiple models and let users choose
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed, especially for code-heavy responses

## What's Next

The journey of building developer tools is never complete. Future plans include:
- Local model support for privacy-conscious users
- IDE integrations for seamless workflow
- Collaborative features for team coding sessions
- Custom model fine-tuning for specific codebases

Building MavroChat taught me that the best developer tools are built by developers, for developers. When you understand the pain points firsthand, you can create solutions that truly make a difference.
