Contributing to open source can feel daunting. The codebases are large, the standards are high, and imposter syndrome is real. Here's how I went from Nango user to contributor, and what I learned along the way.

## Discovering Nango

I first encountered Nango while building integrations for a client project. The promise was compelling: a unified API for building native integrations. Instead of learning each API's quirks, Nango normalized everything.

But I found gaps. The ClickSend integration I needed didn't exist. Instead of switching tools, I saw an opportunity.

## The First Contribution

My first PR was tiny - fixing a typo in documentation. But it taught me the process:
- Fork and clone
- Find the contribution guidelines
- Follow the code style
- Write clear commit messages
- Be patient with reviews

That small PR gave me confidence to tackle bigger challenges.

## Building the ClickSend Integration

Nango's architecture is elegant. Each integration follows a pattern:

```typescript
// nango-integrations/clicksend/syncs/messages.ts
export default async function fetchMessages({ 
  nango, 
  lastSyncDate 
}: NangoSync) {
  const config = await nango.getConfig();
  
  // Paginated fetching with error handling
  for await (const page of nango.paginate({
    endpoint: '/messages',
    params: { 
      date_from: lastSyncDate 
    }
  })) {
    const messages = mapToNangoFormat(page);
    await nango.batchSave(messages, 'Message');
  }
}
```

The framework handles:
- Authentication
- Rate limiting  
- Error retries
- Data persistence

I just needed to map the API to Nango's models.

## Diving Deeper

After the integration was merged, I stayed involved:

### Code Contributions
- Fixed edge cases in OAuth flows
- Improved error messages
- Added missing TypeScript types
- Optimized webhook processing

### Documentation
- Wrote integration guides
- Added code examples
- Clarified setup steps
- Created troubleshooting sections

### Community
- Answered questions in Discord
- Reviewed other PRs
- Shared integration patterns
- Reported bugs I found

## Technical Lessons

### 1. Reading Before Writing
I spent days reading Nango's code before writing. Understanding the architecture, conventions, and patterns made my contributions better.

### 2. Tests Are Documentation
Nango's test suite taught me how things should work:

```typescript
it('should handle rate limit retries', async () => {
  const mock = nock('https://api.example.com')
    .get('/users')
    .reply(429, {}, { 'Retry-After': '2' })
    .get('/users')
    .reply(200, { users: [] });
    
  await sync.run();
  
  expect(mock.isDone()).toBe(true);
});
```

### 3. Small PRs Win
My successful PRs were focused:
- One feature or fix
- Clear description
- Tests included
- Documentation updated

Large PRs sat in review longer and often needed major changes.

### 4. Communication Matters
Clear PR descriptions saved everyone time:

```markdown
## What
Add ClickSend SMS integration

## Why  
Users requested ClickSend support for sending transactional SMS

## How
- Implemented sync for messages
- Added action for sending SMS  
- Included rate limit handling
- Added comprehensive tests

## Testing
- Unit tests pass
- Manually tested with real ClickSend account
- Verified rate limiting works
```

## The Nango Toolkit

Working with Nango taught me professional development practices:

### npx nango dryrun
Testing integrations locally before deployment:
```bash
npx nango dryrun clicksend:messages --lastSyncDate 2024-01-01
```

### Zod Schemas
Type-safe API response validation:
```typescript
const MessageSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  to: z.string(),
  from: z.string().optional(),
  body: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(['sent', 'delivered', 'failed']),
  created_at: z.string().datetime()
});
```

### Vitest
Fast, TypeScript-first testing that actually makes sense.

## Career Impact

Contributing to Nango opened doors:
- **Credibility**: "Nango contributor" carries weight
- **Network**: Connected with talented developers
- **Skills**: Learned enterprise-grade patterns
- **Confidence**: If I can contribute there, I can contribute anywhere

## Advice for New Contributors

### Start Where You Are
- Use the project first
- Find pain points
- Fix what bothers you
- Share your solutions

### Read Everything
- Contribution guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Architecture docs
- Existing PRs

### Be Professional
- Clear communication
- Responsive to feedback
- Patient with reviews
- Grateful for time

### Think Long Term
Open source is a marathon:
- Build reputation slowly
- Quality over quantity
- Relationships matter
- Give back to community

## The Open Source Mindset

Contributing to Nango changed how I code:
- I write more documentation
- I think about API design
- I consider edge cases
- I value clear code

Every project benefits from these practices.

## What's Next?

I continue contributing to Nango and other projects. Each contribution teaches something new. The open source community gave me so much - it's only right to give back.

If you're hesitating to contribute, start today. Find a project you use, fix something small, and submit that PR. The community is more welcoming than you think.
