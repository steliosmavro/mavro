# MavroDev App Guidelines

- Follow project-wide standards in `.cursor/rules/project-guidelines.mdc`.
- This is a personal portfolio and blog built with Next.js (App Router).
- Uses `@repo/ui` for shared UI components, `@repo/eslint-config` and `@repo/typescript-config` for linting and TS config.
- Key structure:
  - `src/app/`: Application routes, layouts, and pages (App Router, includes blog, projects, contact)
  - `src/components/`: UI and shared components (e.g., RenderMdx)
  - `src/content/`: Content files (e.g., markdown, MDX, blog posts)
  - `src/lib/`: Application logic, utilities (e.g., getBlogPosts)
  - `public/`: Static assets
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- Follows [Next.js project structure guide](mdc:https:/nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure).
- Use `npm run dev --workspace=mavrodev` for local development.
- Integrate with shared packages from `packages/`.
- For build and deploy, see Turborepo docs: https://turbo.build/repo/docs
